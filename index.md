### Introduction


 
### Research Question

This project is designed to create a robot that can navigate through a granular media using bioinspired characteristics from the salamander while using foldable robotic designs.

### Background and Biomechanics
When working towards a a robot that can operate in a granular media the team chose to look at creatures that can move efficiently in granular media already. Salamanders are a creature that can move efficiently over

### Kinematics and Dynamics
We modeled the system's kinematics and dynamics using Python and Pynamics.

### Design Optimization
We optimized our design on two different parameters. The angles of the spine from one link to another was optimized with experimetal data. The length of each of the leg links was optimized using scipy.
